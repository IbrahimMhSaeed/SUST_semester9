# Introduction to Medical Imaging

## What is Medical Imaging?
Using an instrument to `see the inside` of a human body
- None-invasive
- Some with exposure to small amount of `radiation` (X-ray, CT, and nuclear Medicine)
- Some without (MRI, and Ultrasound)

#### The `properties imaged` vary depending on the imaging modality
- **X-ray** (projection or CT): attenuation coefficient.
    - for hard tissue
    - waves die as it passes through the body
- **Ultrasound**: sound reflectivity
- **MRI**: hydrogen proton density, spin relaxation
## Types of Medical Imaging
It has many classifications
### Ionizing vs Non-Ionizing

*Fun fact:*
A single chest x-ray exposes the patient to about 0.1 mSv. This is about the same amount of radiation people are exposed to naturally over the course of about 10 days.

### Projection vs. Tomography
#### Projection
A single image is created for a 3D body, which is a `”shadow”` of the body in a particular direction

Projection means collapsing from higher to lower dimension
Vector projection | Mirror projection

In projection you lose information of depth but you gain inside insight.
All volume info collapse into one pixel value

*Notice that ribs and spinal cord all appear in a frontal image*
#### Tomography
Tomography (slicing) refers to imaging by sections of `sectioning`, that uses any kind of penetrating wave
- A series of images are generated one from each slice of a 3D object in a particular direction

*fun fact: usually used with brain to view its different sections*
#### How image is formed?
To form image of each slice, projections along different directions are first obtained.
Images are then reconstructed from projections.
### Anatomical vs. Functional Imaging
#### Anatomical
Some modalities are very good at showing anatomical structure:
- X-ray, CT
- MRI (mainly soft-tissue)
#### Functional
Some modalities don’t show anatomical structure well, but reflect the functional status `real time`
- Ultrasound
- PET, f-MRI

## Electromagnetic Spectrum
![]( https://www.oc.nps.edu/NWDC_EM_Course/course_materials/images/EMSpec.gif)
- All EM waves are photons but with different energies
- They move in all mediums but fastest in space ($\3 * 10^8 m/s$)
### Ultrasound (kHz – MHz)
- Is not in EM
- Mechanical wave (sound) generated by oscillations
- Require medium to transmit
### Relation between Energy, Frequency, and Wavelength
**Blank Equation**
$\E = hf$
**Wave speed equation**
$\v = lambda * f$
v= is the speed of light in medium

-------------------------------
### Frequency Describtion
### Radio Waves (RF  $10^6 – 10^10 Hz$)
- FM (80 – 180 MHz)
- Phone (900 MHz, 1.8 GHz)
### Micro Waves ($\1 – 10^-4m$)
- used in communication (satellite) 
- cooking
-----------------------
### Wave Length
** Why change to wavelength?**
- decimal points don’t appear in Hz (very large)
- hard to count after Tera
### Infrared ($\780 nm and 1 mm$)
### Visible Light ($\400nm – 757nm$)

### Ultraviolet

- tanning cause burn
- Excessive exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation can indeed increase the risk of developing certain types of skin cancer
- UVB radiation is the primary cause of sunburn and plays a key role in the development of skin cancer. It damages the DNA in skin cells, which can lead to mutations and the uncontrolled growth of cells, forming cancerous tumors over time.
- UVA radiation, although less intense than UVB, can also contribute to skin cancer development and cause skin aging.
------------------
### Energy
### Soft X-rays
### Hard X-ray
generated from the electronic cloud
### Gamma Rays
generated from the nucleus 
When you detect X-ray or Gamma they are the same thing but only differ in source
### MRI (RF)

## Other Readings
### Facts about X-ray
- Operators have higher risk of radiation than patients. they usually have cancer in the neck area duo to its low protection
![]( https://img.medicalexpo.com/images_me/photo-mg/107733-18359393.jpg)
- When an X-ray is taken, the calcium in the bones absorbs the X-rays, creating a contrast between the bones and the surrounding tissues on the X-ray image. This allows doctors and radiologists to examine the structure and health of bones
### What are the 3 planes of the body?
Coronal (frontal) plane | Sagittal (longitudinal) plane | Transverse (axial) (horizontal) plane

These holes are spaced appropriately so that the long microwaves are kept bouncing inside the chamber, while also allowing you to peer through and view your food
### Some Image Terminology
- **Contrast:** The difference in brightness or density between different areas or structures within a medical image. Contrast agents may be used to enhance the visibility of certain tissues or abnormalities.

- **Intensity:** The brightness or darkness of a pixel in a medical image, representing the amount of radiation or signal received from that particular area.

- **Windowing:** The process of adjusting the range of pixel intensities displayed in a medical image to optimize visualization of specific structures or details.

- **Slice:** A two-dimensional cross-sectional image of a body part or organ, obtained from a series of images captured during a medical imaging procedure.

- **Voxel:** Short for "volume element," a voxel represents a three-dimensional pixel, consisting of a volume unit in a medical image.

- **Image Resolution:** The level of detail or sharpness in a medical image, determined by the number of pixels or voxels in the image.

- **Field of View (FOV):** The extent of the anatomy or region captured in a medical image, typically measured in centimeters.

- **Image Reconstruction:** The process of converting raw data acquired during a medical imaging procedure into a meaningful image using computational algorithms.

- **Image Artifact:** Any unintended feature or distortion present in a medical image that is not representative of the actual anatomy or pathology, often caused by technical factors or patient-related issues.

- **Image Registration:** The process of aligning and overlaying multiple medical images or datasets to compare or fuse information from different imaging modalities or time points.

- **ROI (Region of Interest):** A specific area or region within a medical image that is selected for analysis, measurement, or further processing.

- **Dose Optimization:** Techniques and protocols employed to minimize radiation dose exposure to patients during medical imaging procedures while maintaining image quality.

- **Image Segmentation:** The process of identifying and delineating specific structures or regions of interest within a medical image, often used for volumetric measurements or pathology detection.

- **Image Fusion:** The combination of multiple imaging modalities or datasets to create a comprehensive and more informative representation of a specific area or condition.

- **CAD (Computer-Aided Diagnosis/Detection):** The use of computer algorithms and analysis tools to assist radiologists in interpreting medical images and detecting abnormalities.
